  type = NULL, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{from}{Character, local path to the file to upload.}

\item{name}{Character, name the file should have on Google Drive. Will
default to its local name.}

on your Google Drive. Can be an actual path (character), a file id marked
with \code{\link{as_id}()}, or a \code{\link{dribble}}.}

\item{overwrite}{A logical scalar, do you want to overwrite a file already on
Google Drive, if such exists?}

\item{type}{Character. If type = \code{NULL}, a MIME type is automatically

suitable type, you can request conversion to Google Doc, Sheet or Slides by
setting \code{type} to \code{document}, \code{spreadsheet}, or \code{presentation},
respectively. All non-\code{NULL} values for \code{type} are pre-processed with
\code{\link[=drive_mime_type]{drive_mime_type()}}.}

(default \code{TRUE}).}
