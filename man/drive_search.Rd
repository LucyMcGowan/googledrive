## list "My Drive" w/o regard for folder hierarchy
drive_search()

## search for files located directly in your root folder
drive_search(q = "'root' in parents")

## filter for folders

## get contents of the folder 'abc' (non-recursive)
## THIS WORKFLOW WILL GET SMOOTHER!
## first, get the folder's id
x <- drive_path("abc")
## now, search for files with this folder as direct parent
q_clause <- paste(shQuote(x$id), "in parents")
drive_search(q = q_clause)

## files whose names match a regex
drive_search(pattern = "jt")

## filter for  Google Sheets
