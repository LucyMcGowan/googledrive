drive_search(pattern = NULL, type = NULL, n_max = Inf, ...,
  verbose = TRUE)
}

\item{pattern}{Character. If provided, only the files whose names match this
regular expression are returned.}

\item{type}{Character. If provided, only files of this type will be returned.
Can be anything that \code{\link[=drive_mime_type]{drive_mime_type()}} knows how to handle. This is
processed by googledrive and sent as a query parameter.}

\item{n_max}{Integer. An upper bound on the number of files to return. This
applies to the results returned by the API, which may be further filtered
locally, via the \code{pattern} argument.}

\item{...}{Query parameters to pass along to the API query.}

\item{verbose}{Logical, indicating whether to print informative messages
(default \code{TRUE}).}
}

}
\description{
This is the closest googledrive function to what you get from
\url{https://drive.google.com}: by default, you just get a listing of your files.
You can also narrow the search in various ways, such as by file type, whether
it's yours or shared with you, starred status, etc.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
## list "My Drive" w/o regard for folder hierarchy
drive_search()

## search for files located directly in your root folder
drive_search(q = "'root' in parents")

## filter for folders
drive_search(type = "folder")
drive_search(q = "mimeType = 'application/vnd.google-apps.folder'")

## filter for Google Sheets
drive_search(type = "spreadsheet")
drive_search(q = "mimeType='application/vnd.google-apps.spreadsheet'")

## files whose names match a regex
drive_search(pattern = "jt")

## control page size or cap the number of files returned
drive_search(pageSize = 50)
drive_search(n_max = 75)
drive_search(pageSize = 5, n_max = 15)
}
