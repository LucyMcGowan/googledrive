regular expression are returned.}

\item{type}{Character. If provided, only files of this type will be returned.

filter for a regex in the file names and/or on MIME type. This is a thin
wrapper around \code{\link[=drive_search]{drive_search()}}.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
## get contents of the folder 'abc' (non-recursive)
drive_ls("abc")

## get contents of folder 'abc' that contain the
## letters 'def'
drive_ls(path = "abc", pattern = "def")

## get all Google spreadsheets in folder 'abc'
## that contain the letters 'def'
drive_ls(path = "abc", pattern = "def", type = "spreadsheet")
