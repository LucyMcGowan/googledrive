\title{List contents of a folder or Team Drive}
\usage{
drive_ls(path = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{Specifies a single folder on Google Drive whose contents you want
to list. Can be an actual path (character), a file id or URL marked with
\code{\link[=as_id]{as_id()}}, or a \code{\link{dribble}}. If it is a Team Drive or is a folder on a Team
Drive, it must be passed as a \code{\link{dribble}}.}

\item{...}{Any parameters that are valid for \code{\link[=drive_find]{drive_find()}}.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{\link{dribble}}, a tibble with one row per
  item.
}
\description{
List the contents of a folder or Team Drive, nonrecursively. This is a thin
wrapper around \code{\link[=drive_find]{drive_find()}}, that simply limits the search to direct
children of a specific folder or to top-level items of a Team Drive.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
## get contents of the folder 'abc' (non-recursive)
drive_ls("abc")

## get contents of folder 'abc' that contain the
## letters 'def'
drive_ls(path = "abc", pattern = "def")

## get all Google spreadsheets in folder 'abc'
## that contain the letters 'def'
drive_ls(path = "abc", pattern = "def", type = "spreadsheet")
}
}
