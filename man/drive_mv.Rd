\title{Move a Drive file.}
\usage{
drive_mv(file = NULL, path = NULL, name = NULL, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{file}{Drive File, something that identifies the file of interest
on your Google Drive. This can be name(s)/path(s), marked file id(s),
or a \code{dribble}.}

\item{path}{Specifies target destination for \code{file} or copy of
\code{file} on Google Drive. Can be an actual path (character), a file id
marked with \code{\link{as_id}()}, or a \code{\link{dribble}}. If specified
as an actual path, it is best to explicitly indicate if it's a folder by
including a trailing slash, since it cannot always be worked out from the
context of the call.}

\item{name}{Character, new file name if not specified as part of \code{path}. Any
name obtained from \code{path} overrides this argument. Defaults to current
name.}

\item{verbose}{Logical, indicating whether to print informative messages
(default \code{TRUE}).}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{\link{dribble}}, a tibble with
   one row per file.
}
\description{
Move a Drive file to a different folder, give it a different name, or both.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
## create a file to move
file <- drive_upload(system.file("DESCRIPTION"), "DESC")

## rename it, but leave in current folder (root folder, in this case)
file <- drive_mv(file, "DESC-renamed")

## create a folder to move the file into
folder <- drive_mkdir("new-folder")

## move the file and rename it again,
## specify destination as a dribble
file <- drive_mv(file, path = folder, name = "DESC-re-renamed")

## verify renamed file is now in the folder
drive_ls(folder)

## move the file back to root folder
file <- drive_mv(file, "~/")

## move it again
## specify destination as path with trailing slash
## to ensure we get a move vs. renaming it to "new-folder"
file <- drive_mv(file, "new-folder/")
}
}
