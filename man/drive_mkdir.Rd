\title{Create a folder on Drive.}
\usage{
drive_mkdir(path = NULL, name = NULL, verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{Specifies target destination for the new folder on Google
Drive. Can be an actual path (character), a file id marked with
\code{\link{as_id}()}, or a \code{\link{dribble}}. If specified as an
actual path, it is best to explicitly indicate if it's a folder by
including a trailing slash, since it cannot always be worked out from the
context of the call. {}}

\item{name}{Character, new folder name if not specified as part of
\code{path}. This will force \code{path} to be treated as a folder, even if
it is character and lacks a trailing slash. {}}

\item{verbose}{Logical, indicating whether to print informative messages
(default \code{TRUE}).}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{\link{dribble}}, a tibble with one row per
  item.
}
\description{
Create a folder on Drive.

\examples{
\dontrun{
## Create folder named "def" in existing folder "abc".
drive_mkdir("abc/def")

## This will also create a folder named "def" in folder "abc".
drive_mkdir(path = "abc", name = "def")

## Another way to create a folder named "def" in folder "abc",
## this time with parent folder stored in a dribble.
abc <- as_dribble("abc")
drive_mkdir(path = abc, name = "def")

## Yet another way to do this,
## this time with parent folder provide via id.
drive_mkdir(path = as_id(abc$id), name = "def")
}
