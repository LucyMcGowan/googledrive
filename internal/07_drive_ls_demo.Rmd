very brief demo

```{r}
library(googledrive)
```

## here is what my most recent files look like:
```{r}
drive_ls()
```
Notice I have lots of folders named the same name!

## now we can query by path

```{r}
drive_ls(path = "foo/bar/baz")
```
In this subdirectory, I have 2 things, a folder named `yo` and a file named `my_file`.

## can still pass other query parameters
```{r}
drive_ls(path = "foo/bar/baz",q = "mimeType='application/vnd.google-apps.folder'")
```

## can also pass patterns

```{r}
drive_ls(path = "foo/bar/baz", pattern = "my_file")
```
