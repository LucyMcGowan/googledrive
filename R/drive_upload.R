#' Upload a file to Google Drive
#'
#' @param from character, local path to the file to upload
#' @param up_name character, name the file should have on Google Drive. Will
#'   default to its local name.
#' @param up_folder character, name of parent folder on Google Drive. Will
#'   default to user's root folder, i.e. the top-level of "My Drive".
#' @param overwrite logical, do you want to overwrite a file already on Google
#'   Drive, if such exists?
#' @param type character. If type = `NULL`, a MIME type is automatically
#'   determined from the file extension, if possible. If the source file is of a
#'   suitable type, you can request conversion to Google Doc, Sheet or Slides by
#'   setting `type` to `document`, `spreadsheet`, or `presentation`,
#'   respectively.
#' @param verbose logical, indicating whether to print informative messages
#'   (default `TRUE`)
#'
#'  MIME types that can be converted to native Google formats:
#'    * <https://developers.google.com/drive/v3/web/manage-uploads#importing_to_google_docs_types_wzxhzdk18wzxhzdk19>
#'
#' @return object of class `gfile` and `list` that contains uploaded file's
#'   information
#' @export
